# Eyevinn Open Source Cloud

## Turn Your Open Source Project into a Revenue Stream

Welcome to [Eyevinn Open Source Cloud](https://www.osaas.io) - the platform that democratizes infrastructure and creates sustainable revenue for open source creators.

### Why Eyevinn Open Source Cloud Benefits You as a Creator

**🚀 Zero Infrastructure Costs**  
Your users get enterprise-grade hosting and scaling without you managing servers, paying hosting bills, or dealing with DevOps complexity. We handle the infrastructure so you can focus on what you do best - building great software.

**💰 Monetize Your Open Source Work**  
Finally get paid for your contributions to the open source ecosystem. When users deploy your project through our platform, you automatically receive a share of the revenue. No complicated pricing models or payment processing required.

**📈 Reach More Users**  
Remove the biggest barrier to adoption - deployment complexity. Your project becomes instantly accessible to non-technical users and small teams who need your solution but lack the resources for self-hosting.

**🎯 Level the Playing Field**  
Small and medium projects now have access to the same infrastructure capabilities as big tech companies. Your innovative tool can compete on features, not on who has the biggest infrastructure budget.

### How It Works

1. **Claim Ownership**: Create your account on [osaas.io](https://www.osaas.io) and connect your GitHub account
2. **Automatic Recognition**: We verify your ownership of this repository
3. **Instant Revenue**: Start earning from every deployment of your project
4. **Focus on Code**: Continue developing while we handle scaling, security, and operations

### For Your Users

Users pay only for what they use, getting professional-grade hosting without the complexity. They can deploy your project in minutes instead of hours or days, making your solution accessible to a broader audience.
